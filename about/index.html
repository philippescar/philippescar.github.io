        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Phil Carvalho and I am a seasoned Manager with over 18 years of experience in
            the tech industry.</p>

        <p>Throughout my career, I have worked in various roles such as Tech Lead, Engineering Manager, and Senior
            Engineer Manager. My passion for technology and leadership has driven me to continuously improve my skills
            and knowledge, allowing me to effectively lead and motivate my teams to achieve exceptional results.</p>

        <p>As a Manager, I prioritize building a strong team culture and fostering an environment of collaboration and
            innovation. I believe that empowering my team members to take ownership of their work and providing them
            with the necessary resources and support leads to higher productivity, job satisfaction, and ultimately
            better outcomes for the organization.</p>

        <p>In addition to my managerial skills, I have a strong technical background and am proficient in Site
            Reliability Engineering Topics, Golang and Python Development. This knowledge has enabled me to effectively
            communicate with technical teams and provide guidance on complex technical projects.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy cooking and photograph. I find that pursuing my passions outside of work helps
            me maintain a healthy work-life balance and fuels my creativity.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
